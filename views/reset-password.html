<h1>Password help</h1>

<p>Have you forgotten your password? We can help with the password but not with your memory. We hear that Ginko Biloba helps with that stuff. You could also try 1Password or something like it. If you're really absent minded, grab a napkin and write it down. Seriously, we don't want to see you back on this page again.</p>


<form ng-submit="resetPassword(email)" novalidate>

	<button type=submit>Send new password</button>
