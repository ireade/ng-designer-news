# Designer News Clone with AngularJS and Firebase

This is a clone of the real [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com) made with AngularJS and Firebase. I am fairly new to these technologies, and wanted to create this as a way to learn how to use them. You can read about my process on my [blog](http://bitsofco.de/2015/building-a-designer-news-clone/).

Any feedback is appreciated!
